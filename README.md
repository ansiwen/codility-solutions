These are my solutions to some of the codility tasks, which you can find at https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/

The solution to NumberOfDiscIntersections (https://codility.com/demo/take-sample-test/number_of_disc_intersections/) has a time complexity of only O(N) instead of the required O(N*log(N)).
